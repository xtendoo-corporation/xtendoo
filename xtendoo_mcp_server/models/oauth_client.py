"""OAuth 2.1 client registry for the native MCP authorization server.

Each record is a relying party (typically an MCP browser client) provisioned via
RFC 7591 dynamic client registration. The model doubles as Authlib's
``ClientMixin`` so the authorization server validates redirect URIs, grant /
response types and the (public-client) token-endpoint auth method straight off
the stored fields. These are public PKCE clients only -- no client secret is
ever issued or stored.
