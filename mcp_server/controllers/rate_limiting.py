    """Thread-safe per-key sliding-window request counter.

    Backed by a PLAIN dict, keyed by an opaque caller key (a client IP, or a
    ``(dbname, user_id)`` tuple). A *lookup* must never insert a key, so reads go
    through ``dict.get(key, ())`` -- a ``defaultdict`` would mint (and then keep
    forever) a bucket for every distinct key merely observed.

    That distinction is load-bearing: callers key this by client IP on
    unauthenticated endpoints, and over IPv6 an attacker can present a fresh
    source address on every request, so a key seen exactly once must not linger.
    Every call prunes the *caller's own* stale timestamps; on top of that, at
    most once per window, an amortized cross-bucket sweep drops every bucket that
    holds no live entry. The sweep is deliberately NOT run on each call --
    sweeping on a distinct-key flood would be O(n^2); once-per-window keeps it
    O(1) amortized and bounds both memory and CPU (the DoS backstop must not
    itself become a memory-exhaustion vector).

    Timestamps are ``time.monotonic()`` seconds, so the window is immune to
    wall-clock jumps (NTP steps, DST).
