# amplify into one connection checkout + fsync per request. Past the cap the
# committed write is skipped (the 401 / XML-RPC fault is unaffected), so normal
# load still logs and only a flood is throttled. The ``/mcp`` bearer door
# already carries its own ``ir_http._bearer_failure_limiter`` gate; this one
# additionally covers the legacy callers. Mirrors that limiter and
# ``mcp._audit_write_limiter``. In-memory => per worker.

    ``api_key_used`` records whether the rejected credential was an API key.
    Defaults to ``True`` for the X-API-Key / api-key callers; the MCP bearer door
    passes ``False`` because a failed bearer is neither a confirmed API key nor,
    once the OAuth door has also failed, distinguishable as one.

    ``user_id`` attributes the failure to a resolved-but-refused user (the
    access-group gate rejects a VALID credential); credential failures have no
    user to attribute and leave it ``None``.

    The row is written on a fresh, explicitly-committed cursor in production so it
    survives the request-transaction reset a rejected ``/mcp`` bearer causes (and
    on the request cursor under tests) -- see :func:`audit.write_audit_row`. The
    write runs as ``SUPERUSER_ID`` because no user is authenticated on a failure.

    Throttled per IP (see ``_auth_failure_limiter``): past the window budget for
    that IP the write is skipped, so a bad-credential flood on the legacy REST /
    XML-RPC callers cannot amplify into one fsync per request. Under normal
    (non-flood) load the budget is never reached, so legitimate audit rows are
