"""Issued OAuth 2.1 access/refresh tokens for the native MCP endpoint.

Tokens are opaque; only their SHA-256 hashes are persisted. The model implements
Authlib's ``TokenMixin`` so the authorization and resource servers can check
client binding, scope, expiry and revocation off the stored fields. Refresh
tokens rotate on every use and share a ``refresh_family_id`` so a replayed
(already rotated) refresh token can be traced to its whole chain for revocation.
