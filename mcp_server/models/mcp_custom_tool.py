"""Admin-defined MCP tools backed by ``ir.actions.server``.

Each record exposes a curated verb (e.g. ``confirm_sale_order``) to MCP clients
instead of enabling generic CRUD on a model. The wrapped server action runs as
the calling user; access is the action's own boundary, enforced by the module
(non-su) at list and call time. The wrapped model does NOT need to be listed in
``mcp.enabled.model``, and that model's per-operation Allow flags do NOT apply --
the tool-level gate (plus the caller's ACLs) is the control, so a custom tool can
perform an operation disabled on ``mcp.enabled.model``.

This file holds the model, its constraints and security, plus the execution
runner (``_run_tool`` / ``_visible_tools``) that the ``tools/list`` and
``tools/call`` endpoints drive. ``tools/list`` searches this table live per
request, so edits take effect immediately (no cache to invalidate).
