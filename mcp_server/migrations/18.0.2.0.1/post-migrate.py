"""Grant the MCP User access group to users with existing MCP activity.

Membership in ``xtendoo_mcp_server.group_mcp_user`` is required on every MCP surface.
Active internal users with prior MCP activity -- an ``mcp``-scope API key, an
OAuth token, or an MCP audit-log entry recording a completed operation --
receive the group automatically so their integrations keep working; for
everyone else access is an explicit admin decision.
