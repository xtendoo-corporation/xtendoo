# MCP Server for Odoo

An Odoo module that enables Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, allowing AI
assistants to securely access and interact with your Odoo data. Supports full CRUD
operations - create, read, update, and delete records through natural language.

The module **speaks MCP natively**: it exposes a built-in MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, so any
MCP client — Claude (web, desktop, mobile, Claude Code), ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot,
Perplexity, Mistral Le Chat, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector — can connect
**directly to your Odoo URL** with no separate process to install (see the
[client compatibility table](#client-compatibility)). There are three ways to connect,
from simplest to most involved:

1. **[Log in with Odoo (OAuth 2.1)](#option-1-log-in-with-odoo-oauth-21--recommended)**
   — paste your Odoo URL into the client and sign in. No keys to create or copy.
2. **[API key (Bearer token)](#option-2-api-key-bearer-token)** — mint a key once and
   configure it as an `Authorization: Bearer` header.
3. **[Standalone local client (`uvx mcp-server-odoo`)](#option-3-standalone-local-client-uvx-mcp-server-odoo)**
   — a bridge process for stdio-only MCP clients, using the same module APIs.

## Features

- 🔌 **Native MCP Endpoint**: Built-in `/mcp` endpoint (Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0) —
  connect MCP clients straight to Odoo, no extra software
- 🔑 **Log in with Odoo (OAuth 2.1)**: browser-based clients connect with a normal Odoo
  login and a per-request consent screen — no API key handling
- 🔐 **Secure API Access**: API key **or** OAuth 2.1 authentication with rate limiting
- 📖 **Read-Only Consent**: grant an AI assistant read-only access with one checkbox at
  the OAuth consent screen (`mcp:read` / `mcp:write` scopes)
- 🗝️ **"MCP Only" API Keys**: mint keys that work only on the MCP endpoint — a leaked
  key cannot be used for general RPC
- 🧭 **User Context on Connect**: the handshake tells the assistant who is connected,
  their timezone and companies, so it stops guessing
- 🧩 **Custom Tools**: expose curated verbs (e.g. `confirm_sale_order`) backed by server
  actions instead of generic CRUD
- 📎 **Attachments**: read a PDF, image or file attached to a record from any client,
  list a record's attachments, upload new ones
- 🎯 **Granular Permissions**: Control read/write/create/delete access per model
- 🌐 **REST & XML-RPC APIs**: Dual protocol support for maximum compatibility
- 👥 **Role-Based Access**: MCP access is granted per user through the MCP User and
  MCP Administrator security groups
- 📊 **Audit Log**: every call, denial and auth attempt is recorded in `mcp.log`
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly UI**: Integrated configuration in Odoo settings

## Requirements

**Odoo 19.0** (Community or Enterprise). This module targets Odoo 19.0 and uses v19-only APIs.

You always need **this Odoo module** installed and configured (it provides the MCP
protocol, access control, and security layer). Whichever way a client connects — OAuth,
API key, or the standalone bridge — every call runs as a real Odoo user and shares the
same `mcp.enabled.model` permissions, audit log, and rate limiting.

The module needs the `authlib` (`>=1.6.12,<1.7.0`), `defusedxml` and `packaging` Python
packages — declared in the manifest's `external_dependencies` and mirrored in the
`requirements.txt` shipped inside the module. `authlib` is intentionally
capped below 1.7.0: 1.7.x pulls in a newer `cryptography` (via `joserfc`) that many Odoo
deploy images cannot install over their system `cryptography`/`pyOpenSSL`, which breaks
installation and the server's `import OpenSSL`. `packaging` lets Odoo parse the version pin.

Install them into the Python environment that runs Odoo:

```bash
pip install -r mcp_server/requirements.txt
# or explicitly:
pip install "authlib>=1.6.12,<1.7.0" defusedxml packaging
```

**On Odoo.sh** (and similar platforms that auto-install Python dependencies): only the
`requirements.txt` at the **root of your repository** (or of a submodule) is installed —
a `requirements.txt` inside an addon folder is ignored. Reference the module's file from
your repo-root `requirements.txt`:

```
-r path/to/mcp_server/requirements.txt
```

or copy its lines there verbatim.

**Before connecting anything**: go to **Settings > MCP Server**, turn on the master
switch, and enable the models you want to expose with their per-operation permissions.
See [Configure the Module](#step-2-configure-the-module).

## Connecting AI Assistants

### Option 1: Log in with Odoo (OAuth 2.1) — recommended

The simplest way to connect: give the client your Odoo MCP URL and **sign in with your
normal Odoo login**. No API key is created, copied, or stored in a config file. The
module is itself a complete OAuth 2.1 authorization server, so any MCP client that
supports OAuth for remote servers works out of the box:

- **Claude.ai (web)**: **Settings > Connectors > Add custom connector**, paste
  `https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp`, then complete the Odoo login and consent screen.
- **Claude Desktop**: same **Connectors** UI (Settings > Connectors > Add custom
  connector).
- **Claude Code (CLI)**:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http much-odoo https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp
  ```

  then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code and choose **Authenticate** — the browser opens
  your Odoo login.

- **ChatGPT**: enable **Developer Mode**, then **Settings > Apps & Connectors > Advanced
  settings > Create app** with the same URL — the Odoo login opens when you connect
  (web, paid plans; details in the [compatibility table](#client-compatibility)).
- **Perplexity / Mistral Le Chat**: add the URL as a custom connector in their
  Connectors settings — the OAuth login starts automatically.
- **Cursor / VS Code**: add the server URL **without** an `Authorization` header (see
  the JSON snippets [below](#option-2-api-key-bearer-token), minus the `headers` key);
  recent versions detect the OAuth challenge and open the login flow automatically.

What happens under the hood (all automatic):

1. The client `POST`s to `/mcp` with no token and gets a `401` whose
   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header carries an RFC 9728 `resource_metadata` pointer to
   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.
2. From the discovery documents the client locates the authorization server and
   **registers itself** at `/mcp/oauth/register` (RFC 7591 dynamic client registration;
   public PKCE client, no secret).
3. The user is sent to `/mcp/oauth/authorize`, signs in with their **normal Odoo
   login**, and approves a **per-request consent screen**. The consent screen includes
   an **"Allow creating and modifying data"** checkbox — uncheck it to grant the
   assistant **read-only** access (see
   [OAuth Read-Only Consent](#oauth-read-only-consent)).
4. The client exchanges the authorization code at `/mcp/oauth/token` (PKCE S256) for an
   opaque **access token bound to that user**. Access tokens are short-lived (1 hour);
   long-lived sessions are kept alive by **rotating refresh tokens**.

Every call runs as the logged-in user, so the same `mcp.enabled.model` permissions, Odoo
access rights, audit log and rate limiting apply as with an API key.

**Managing OAuth clients & tokens (admins).** OAuth activity is managed under
**Settings > Technical > MCP** (MCP Administrator group):

- **OAuth Clients** — applications registered through the authorization flow. Bulk
  **Deactivate** is available from the list view; deactivating a client blocks new
  logins **and** cuts off every token it already issued.
- **OAuth Tokens** — issued tokens, listing the user, client, audience, scope and
  expiry. Open a token and click **Revoke** (or use the bulk list action) to invalidate
  it immediately; the client must then re-authenticate.

A daily scheduled action (`ir.cron`) garbage-collects spent credentials — expired
authorization codes, revoked-and-expired tokens, and stale dynamically-registered
clients — so the tables stay clean. Only credentials that can no longer authenticate
anything are removed.

The OAuth front door is **enabled by default** whenever MCP is enabled. To accept API
keys only, turn off **Allow OAuth 2.1 login** in **Settings > MCP Server** (system
parameter `mcp_server.enable_oauth`).

### Option 2: API key (Bearer token)

For clients where you prefer (or need) to paste a static credential — headless setups,
service accounts, CI, or MCP clients without OAuth support:

1. In Odoo, go to **My Profile > Account Security > New API Key**.
2. Set **Access** to **MCP only** (recommended — see
   ["MCP Only" API Keys](#mcp-only-api-keys)) or keep _All APIs (default)_.
3. Enter a description and copy the key — it is shown only once.
4. Configure the client with the URL and an `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header
   (the `Bearer ` prefix is optional — a bare `Authorization: <API_KEY>` also works). A
   missing or invalid key returns `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge;
   `GET /mcp` returns `405` (the endpoint is POST-only).

**Claude Code (CLI):**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http much-odoo \
  https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or a project `.cursor/mcp.json`, `mcpServers` key):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "much-odoo": {
      "url": "https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** (`.vscode/mcp.json` — note the top-level `servers` key, not `mcpServers`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "much-odoo": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop**: remote (HTTP) servers are added through the **Connectors** UI
(Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector) pointed at
`https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp` — which uses
[OAuth](#option-1-log-in-with-odoo-oauth-21--recommended) and needs no key. To use an
API key instead, bridge a local stdio entry to the remote endpoint with
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote).

**MCP Inspector** (protocol testing):

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Point it at `https://your-company.odoo.com/mcp` and add the header
`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (or leave the header out and use its OAuth flow).

### Option 3: Standalone local client (`uvx mcp-server-odoo`)

The companion open-source client
[**mcp-server-odoo**](https://github.com/ivnvxd/mcp-server-odoo) runs as a small local
process on the machine where your MCP client lives and bridges **stdio** MCP to this
module's XML-RPC/REST API. Use it when your MCP client only speaks stdio (no remote HTTP
servers), or when you want a local process you can pin and configure per project.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-odoo"],
      "env": {
        "ODOO_URL": "https://your-company.odoo.com",
        "ODOO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "ODOO_DB": "your-database-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on the client machine
(`ODOO_DB` is optional when the server exposes its database list). The bridge goes
through the same `mcp.enabled.model` permissions, audit log and rate limits, but it
talks to this module's legacy `/mcp/xmlrpc/*` and `/mcp/*` REST endpoints rather than to
`/mcp`. Those delegate authentication to Odoo core (scope `rpc`), so this client needs a
**global (all-APIs) or `rpc`-scope** key — an [MCP only](#mcp-only-api-keys) key works
on `/mcp` **only** and is rejected here.

Besides stdio, the bridge can also serve **Streamable HTTP** itself
(`--transport streamable-http`) if you want to host it on a trusted network — note it
adds no authentication of its own. See the
[mcp-server-odoo repository](https://github.com/ivnvxd/mcp-server-odoo) for full
instructions: transports, username/password auth, multi-language output, and a
module-less "YOLO" test mode (not recommended for production — it bypasses this module's
per-model access control).

Two practical rules cover most of the table:

- **Cloud-hosted clients** (Claude.ai/mobile connectors, ChatGPT, Perplexity web, Le
  Chat, Copilot, Gemini Enterprise) connect **from the vendor's infrastructure**: your
  Odoo instance must be reachable on public HTTPS, and OAuth is usually the only
  authentication offered for custom connectors — which is exactly what
  [Option 1](#option-1-log-in-with-odoo-oauth-21--recommended) provides.
- **Locally-running clients** (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Gemini CLI, Inspector, the
  uvx bridge) can reach private or localhost instances and may use either OAuth or an
  API-key header.

## Native MCP Endpoint (`/mcp`)

The module exposes a native MCP server at `POST /mcp` (Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0).
The server implements MCP protocol revisions `2025-11-25` (preferred) and `2025-06-18`;
the revision is negotiated during the `initialize` handshake. `/mcp/rpc` is kept as a
legacy alias of the same endpoint, so clients configured against the old path keep
working.

### Available Tools

The endpoint exposes 17 built-in tools (plus any admin-defined
[Custom Tools](#custom-tools)):

| Tool                      | Operation   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_records`          | read        | Search records with smart field selection and pagination |
| `get_record`              | read        | Fetch one record by ID, formatted for LLMs               |
| `get_fields`              | read        | Describe a model's fields (type, label, relation, etc.)  |
| `list_models`             | read        | List the MCP-enabled models                              |
| `aggregate_records`       | read        | Group/aggregate records (`read_group`-style)             |
| `read_attachment`         | read        | Read an attachment or binary field (text, image, link)   |
| `list_record_attachments` | read        | List the files attached to a record                      |
| `list_resource_templates` | read        | Advertise the available `odoo://` resource templates     |
| `get_current_context`     | read        | Return the caller's user / timezone / company context    |
| `create_record`           | create      | Create a record                                          |
| `create_records`          | create      | Create several records of one model in one call          |
| `update_record`           | write       | Update a record                                          |
| `update_records`          | write       | Update several records of one model in one call          |
| `delete_record`           | unlink      | Delete a record                                          |
| `upload_attachment`       | create      | Upload a file as an attachment, optionally to a record   |
| `call_model_method`       | method call | Call a public business method (opt-in per model)         |
| `post_message`            | write       | Post a message to a record's chatter                     |

`search_records` is also the batch read path. One call with a domain such as
`[["id", "in", [1, 2, 3]]]` fetches many records at once. A larger `limit` (up to
the configured maximum) reads a big result set in few calls. The tool descriptions
and the `initialize` instructions steer AI clients toward this pattern instead of
one `get_record` call per record.

`get_fields` returns a curated subset of the schema by default: the most relevant
fields (at most 60) with selection lists cut at 20 options. The result names how many
fields it left out. Pass `field_names` for specific fields, or `["__all__"]` for the
complete schema with full selection lists.

`create_records` and `update_records` are the batch write path. `create_records`
takes one model and a list of field->value objects. `update_records` takes one model and
either `record_ids` plus one `values` object that is written to every listed record, or
`updates`, a list of `{"id": …, "values": {…}}` entries when each record needs its own
values (each id once). Both tools run as the calling user. Both are atomic: if one entry
fails, the whole batch is rolled back and nothing is written. To create a parent with its
children in one atomic call, use nested one2many commands in the values, for example
`"order_line": [[0, 0, {...}]]`. Odoo does not always name the failing entry, so the tool
descriptions tell clients to retry an ambiguous failure in smaller batches. A batch is
capped at **Maximum Batch Size** entries (`mcp_server.max_batch_size`, default 100). A
larger batch is refused with an error that asks the client to split it. The `record_ids`
list of `call_model_method` keeps its own cap, **Maximum Record Limit**
(`mcp_server.max_limit`). One batch call counts as **one** request for rate limiting.
Deletion has no batch tool on purpose: `delete_record` stays one record per call.

### Attachments and Binary Fields

`get_record` and `search_records` never inline binary data. A populated binary or image
field is returned as an `odoo://record/{model}/{id}/{field}` URI, together with a
`binary_note` that points the client at `read_attachment`. Files attached to a record
(chatter attachments, documents) are listed by `list_record_attachments`, each with an
`odoo://attachment/{id}` URI.

`read_attachment` takes such a `uri` (or a plain `attachment_id`) and a `format`:

- `auto` (default): text files come back inline, images as an MCP `image` content block,
  PDF and Office documents as extracted text, and anything else — or anything above the
  inline size caps — as a download link plus metadata. Inline PDF/Office text needs the
  standard `attachment_indexation` module; without it the tool returns the link and says
  so. Inline text is truncated at 100,000 characters (with a link to the full file),
  images and blobs are inlined up to 256 KiB.
- `link`: only a time-limited download URL, no bytes. Works for read-only OAuth sessions
  and for clients that can fetch URLs.
- `blob`: the raw file as an embedded resource (base64 for binary files, text for
  textual mimetypes), refused above 256 KiB.

A download link is a **delegated-access bearer URL**: it is an HMAC token over the
record, field and expiry, redeemed by Odoo's standard `/web/content` route. Anyone who
holds the link can download the file until it expires, without an Odoo login, and the
download bypasses MCP auditing and rate limiting. The tool call that produced the link
is audited as usual. The link validity is **Download Link Validity** in the settings
(`mcp_server.link_ttl_hours`, default 1 hour; the module clamps it at 1008 hours = 42
days, the longest validity Odoo gives its own binary access tokens). Keep it short: an AI
client simply requests a new link when one has expired. A link
cannot be revoked individually; only rotating the database secret invalidates all of
them.

`upload_attachment` creates an `ir.attachment` from base64 content. Pass `model` and
`record_id` to attach it to a record — this is gated as a **write** on that record, both
via MCP (`allow_write`) and by Odoo (write access to the record). Omit both for a
standalone attachment, which requires `ir.attachment` to be MCP-enabled for create. The
content is limited to about 7 MiB by the request body cap. Odoo stores HTML, XML and SVG
uploads from non-privileged users as `text/plain`. The returned URI can be read back
with `read_attachment` and the id linked to a chatter message with
`post_message(attachment_ids=[id])`.

**Gating.** An attachment is readable via MCP when its parent record's model is
MCP-enabled for read, **or** when `ir.attachment` itself is MCP-enabled for read. The
same rule applies to `list_record_attachments`. A record-field URI always requires the
record's own model to be read-enabled; enabling `ir.attachment` never unlocks arbitrary
binary fields. Odoo's attachment access rules apply on top in every case. To enable
`ir.attachment` itself, create the row directly under **Settings > Technical > MCP > MCP
Available Models** — the model selection wizard filters out `ir.*` models.

### Access Control

Every call runs **as the authenticated user** (the API key's owner, or the user who
logged in via OAuth), so Odoo's own access rights and record rules always apply. On top
of that, MCP access is gated by `mcp.enabled.model`:

- A model is reachable only if it is MCP-enabled, with the requested operation allowed
  (`allow_read` / `allow_create` / `allow_write` / `allow_unlink`).
- `call_model_method` additionally requires `allow_method_calls = True` on the model —
  an **admin opt-in, default off**. It exposes only the model's public _business_
  methods; private (leading-underscore), `web_*`, and generic ORM/CRUD methods are
  always rejected, and methods that map to a CRUD operation still require the matching
  per-operation permission. Such business methods may have side effects on this and
  related records (posting messages, scheduling activities, managing followers, etc.),
  but only ever do what the authenticated user could already do in Odoo. Leave it off
  unless you need it — and in particular do **not** enable it on infrastructure/meta
  models such as `ir.actions.server`, `ir.cron`, `base.automation`, `ir.model` or
  `ir.rule`, whose public methods (e.g. `run()`) execute arbitrary configured logic.
- `post_message` is gated as a **write** operation.
- Fields whose **name** looks like a credential (`*password`, `*secret`,
  `*_token`, `api_key` / `secret_key` / `private_key`, …) are omitted from **bulk reads** —
  the smart-default selection and the `["__all__"]` sentinel of `get_record` /
  `search_records` — as a convenience guard. This is best-effort and name-based
  only: explicitly-named fields are still returned, so protect real secrets with
  Odoo field-level `groups=`, which is the enforced boundary.
- Under a read-only OAuth session (scope `mcp:read`), write tools are hidden from
  `tools/list` and refused if called (see
  [OAuth Read-Only Consent](#oauth-read-only-consent)).

All tool calls are written to the audit log (`mcp.log`, browsable under **Settings >
Technical > MCP > MCP Logs**) and subject to per-user rate limiting (in-memory, enforced
per worker process).

The whole `POST /mcp` request body is capped at 10 MiB; since binary fields are written
base64-encoded, this limits a single `create_record` / `update_record` binary write to
roughly 7.5 MiB of decoded data — a larger payload is rejected with HTTP 413. The cap
applies to the whole batch of a `create_records` / `update_records` call, so a batch
that carries binary values reaches it much sooner than a single-record write.

### Resources

The endpoint serves `odoo://` resources so binary/image data is fetched on demand
instead of inlined as base64:

- `odoo://record/{model}/{id}/{field}` — a binary/image field on a record
- `odoo://attachment/{id}` — an `ir.attachment` by ID

`resources/read` is an application-driven MCP primitive that many chat clients do not
let the model call. The `read_attachment` tool accepts the same URIs and works in every
client; see [Attachments and Binary Fields](#attachments-and-binary-fields).

## User Context, Scoped Keys, Read-Only Consent & Custom Tools

These four capabilities were added in **19.0.2** to tighten security and give admins
more control over what MCP clients can do.

### User Context on Connect

LLMs otherwise guess the timezone and pick a wrong company on multi-company databases —
and those guesses turn into wrong writes. To prevent that, the `initialize` handshake
returns a personalized **`instructions`** string that spec-compliant clients inject into
the model's context automatically (zero extra round-trips). It describes the connected
**user**, their **timezone** (or a note that none is set), the **active company**, and
any other **allowed companies**, plus the rule that all datetimes are stored and
returned in **UTC**.

For clients that ignore `instructions`, the same information is available on demand
through the read-only **`get_current_context`** tool. The context only ever exposes the
caller's own user/company information — nothing else.

### "MCP Only" API Keys

By default an Odoo API key is a global credential that works on every RPC surface. You
can instead mint a key that is confined to the MCP endpoint:

1. Go to **My Profile > Account Security > New API Key**.
2. In the key wizard, set **Access** to **MCP only** (the default is _All APIs_).
3. Enter a description and copy the key — it is shown only once.

An **MCP only** key authenticates **only on `/mcp`**, so a leaked key has a much smaller
blast radius — it cannot be used for general XML-RPC/JSON-RPC access to your database
(including this module's own legacy `/mcp/xmlrpc/*` and REST endpoints). Existing keys
are unaffected: global (all-APIs) keys and `rpc`-scope keys keep working on `/mcp`
exactly as before.

### OAuth Read-Only Consent

When a browser client connects via
[OAuth](#option-1-log-in-with-odoo-oauth-21--recommended), the per-request consent
screen shows an **"Allow creating and modifying data"** checkbox (checked by default):

- **Leave it checked** → the session is granted the `mcp:write` scope: the client can
  read **and** write, exactly as before.
- **Uncheck it** → the session is granted the read-only `mcp:read` scope. Write tools
  (`create_record`, `create_records`, `update_record`, `update_records`,
  `delete_record`, `call_model_method`, `post_message`, and any non-read-only
  [custom tool](#custom-tools)) are **not even
  listed** for that session, and any attempt to call one is refused with a clear
  read-only error.

If the client explicitly requests only `mcp:read`, the checkbox is not shown and the
token is read-only. The granted scope is computed server-side and can only ever be
**narrower** than what the client registered for — never wider. Refresh-token rotation
preserves the scope.

> The read/write gate applies to **OAuth tokens only**. API keys stay full-access — the
> per-model registry and Odoo's own access rights remain their control (and an
> [MCP only](#mcp-only-api-keys) key already narrows where a key can be used).

### Custom Tools

Instead of enabling generic `create`/`write` on a model, an administrator can expose a
**curated verb** — e.g. `confirm_sale_order` with a narrow input schema — by wrapping an
Odoo **server action** in a custom tool. Manage them under **Settings > Technical >
MCP > Custom Tools** (MCP Administrator group):

| Field             | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**          | The tool name the LLM calls (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`, unique, no builtin-name collisions) |
| **Description**   | The tool's contract with the LLM — say what it does and what each argument is             |
| **Input Schema**  | JSON Schema (a JSON object) advertised to clients in `tools/list`                         |
| **Read-only**     | Advertised as the tool's `readOnlyHint`; read-only OAuth sessions may call these only     |
| **Server Action** | The `ir.actions.server` executed when the tool is called                                  |

The tool's **arguments** and **result** flow through a shared `mcp` dict exposed to the
server action's Python code: read `mcp['args']` (the client-supplied arguments) and
assign `mcp['result']` (returned to the client, serialized as JSON text). A minimal
copy-paste code action:

```python
# Server action -> Python Code
mcp['result'] = {'echo': mcp['args'].get('x')}
```

Calling this tool with `{"x": "hello"}` returns `{"echo": "hello"}`.

> **Custom tools must wrap a Python Code action.** A custom tool must wrap a **Python
> Code** server action that reads `mcp['args']` and assigns `mcp['result']` (returned to
> the client as JSON text). Other server-action types (_Update a Record_, _Create a new
> Record_, _Duplicate a Record_, _Send Webhook Notification_, _Multi Actions_, and
> Discuss actions such as _Send Email_) are **not supported** and are rejected when you
> save the tool: they run once per selected record, and a tool call passes no record, so
> the action would silently do nothing while still reporting success. A Python Code
> action that assigns nothing to `mcp['result']` still runs — the client just receives a
> generic success message instead of a structured result.

**Access model — read this before exposing a tool:**

- The action runs **as the calling user**, so their Odoo access rights (ACLs) apply to
  everything the action does — a custom tool never grants elevated rights.
- **Who may call the tool** is the action's own **Allowed Groups**: a user must be a
  member of one of them. If the action has **no** Allowed Groups, access falls back to
  requiring **write** access on the action's model (Odoo's core rule) — so even a
  read-only tool then needs model write access. **Set Allowed Groups explicitly** to
  control access cleanly.
- The action's model does **not** need to be in the
  [Enabled Models](#step-2-configure-the-module) list, and — for a model that _is_
  enabled — its per-operation **Allow Read/Create/Write/Delete** flags **do not apply** to
  a custom tool. The tool-level access gate (plus the caller's Odoo ACLs) is the control,
  so a custom tool can perform an operation you disabled there (e.g. create a contact
  while `res.partner` **Allow Create** is off). Scope the wrapped action narrowly.
- A tool a user may not run is **hidden** from their `tools/list` and refused (with a
  sanitized access-denied error) if called directly.
- Under a read-only OAuth session (`mcp:read`), only tools marked **Read-only** are
  listed and callable.

If an action raises, the whole call is rolled back and the client receives a sanitized
error (no traceback or SQL is leaked). Every custom-tool call is written to the audit
log (`mcp.log`).

> **Metadata is visible to authorized callers.** A custom tool's **name**,
> **description** and **input schema** are shown (via an internal privileged read in the
> MCP controller — there is no direct ACL grant on the model) to exactly the users
> allowed to run it: members of the action's Allowed Groups (including portal users), or
> — when no groups are set — users with write access to the action's model. The wrapped
> action's **code** is never exposed by this read (it stays restricted to the
> Settings/Technical group on `ir.actions.server`). Still, do **not** put secrets in a
> tool's name or description.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install from Odoo App Store

1. Download the module
2. Copy to Odoo addons
   ```bash
   cp -r mcp_server /path/to/odoo/addons/
   ```
3. Update the module list:
   - Navigate to Apps in Odoo
   - Click "Update Apps List"
   - Search for "MCP Server"
4. Click Install on the MCP Server module

### Step 2: Configure the Module

1. **Navigate to Settings**:

   - Go to Settings > MCP Server
   - Turn on **Enable MCP Server** (the master switch). Optional switches live here too:
     **Allow OAuth 2.1 login**, rate limiting and its request limit, logging and its
     retention, the default/maximum record limits for tool responses (plus the smart
     field and related-item caps), the **Maximum Batch Size** for
     `create_records` / `update_records`, the **Download Link Validity** of
     `read_attachment` links, and an optional
     **Allowed Browser Origins** allowlist (empty by default = any Origin accepted;
     when set, browser requests from other Origins get HTTP 403 — native clients
     send no Origin header and are never affected).

2. **Enable Models**:

   - Click "Configure Models" or go to **Settings > Technical > MCP > MCP Available
     Models**
   - Add models you want to expose (e.g., res.partner, product.product)
   - Set permissions for each model:
     - ✅ Can Read
     - ✅ Can Write
     - ✅ Can Create
     - ✅ Can Delete
     - (optional) Allow Method Calls — opt-in for `call_model_method`

3. **Connect a client** — see [Connecting AI Assistants](#connecting-ai-assistants):
   OAuth needs no further setup; for API keys, mint one under **My Profile > Account
   Security** (choose **MCP only** for the smallest blast radius).

### Security Groups

The module creates two security groups:

- **MCP Administrator**: Can configure MCP settings, manage enabled models, custom
  tools, OAuth clients/tokens, and read the audit log
- **MCP User**: **Required to use MCP.** Only members can authenticate on any MCP
  surface — the native `/mcp` endpoint (API key or OAuth), the REST endpoints and the
  XML-RPC proxy — and only members can complete the OAuth consent flow. A valid
  credential whose user is not a member is refused with an audited **403** (the OAuth
  consent screen shows a clear error instead), and removing the group cuts off the
  user's outstanding API keys and OAuth tokens immediately. What a member can read or
  write is still bounded by the per-model MCP permissions **and** the user's own Odoo
  access rights.

Assign users to appropriate groups in Settings > Users & Companies > Users.
MCP Administrator implies MCP User, and system administrators (Settings access) are
MCP Administrators automatically. Portal users cannot be members (the group implies
Internal User), so portal accounts can never connect to MCP.

> **Upgrading:** users with existing MCP activity (an **MCP only** API key, an OAuth
> token, or an audit-log entry recording a completed MCP operation) are added to the
> group automatically; assign it manually for anyone else. The audit-log signal only
> reaches users active within `mcp_server.log_retention_days` (default 30) — the daily
> cleanup cron deletes older entries — so users connecting with a global or `rpc`-scope
> API key on a longer cadence will need the group assigned manually.

## Multi-Database Deployment

Before it can authenticate a request, Odoo must resolve **which database** the request
targets — and the Bearer token / OAuth session can't select one, because the API key and
OAuth token live *inside* a database. So on an instance serving **more than one
database**, every `/mcp*` route (including the public `/mcp/health` and the OAuth
discovery documents) returns **404 "No database is selected"** until the target database
is resolved from the request itself. Resolve it at the transport layer:

1. **Hostname per database (recommended)** — the standard Odoo multi-tenant setup: give
   each database its own host and let Odoo map host → database.

   ```ini
   # odoo.conf
   proxy_mode = True
   list_db    = False        # hide the database manager
   dbfilter   = ^%d$         # subdomain → db  (use ^%h$ to match the full host)
   ```

   Point each client at its own host (e.g. `https://acme.example.com/mcp`). This is the
   **only option that works for browser OAuth clients** (Claude.ai web, Gemini): they
   can't send a custom header, but the whole flow stays on one host, so `dbfilter`
   resolves it. Discovery documents and consent redirects are built from the request
   host, so each tenant automatically advertises its own correct URLs.

2. **`X-Odoo-Database` header** — Bearer / API-key clients that can set headers (Claude
   Code, `curl`, custom integrations) can send `X-Odoo-Database: <db>` alongside
   `Authorization`, with no hostname routing. This does **not** help browser OAuth clients.

3. **Single database** — pin the instance with `db_name = <db>` (or `dbfilter = ^<db>$`).

A single-database instance needs none of this — Odoo auto-selects the only database.

## API Endpoints

### Native MCP Endpoint

| Endpoint   | Method | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/mcp`     | POST   | Native MCP server (Streamable HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0). Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — an mcp- or rpc-scope API key or an OAuth 2.1 access token. See [Native MCP Endpoint (`/mcp`)](#native-mcp-endpoint-mcp). |
| `/mcp/rpc` | POST   | Legacy alias of `/mcp` (the pre-rename path) — same endpoint, same auth.                                                                                                                                               |

### OAuth 2.1

The module is an OAuth 2.1 authorization server, so browser clients can log into Odoo
(see [Option 1](#option-1-log-in-with-odoo-oauth-21--recommended)). These endpoints are
public (no API key required).

| Endpoint                                  | Method   | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`   | GET      | RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata for `/mcp`                              |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | GET      | RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata                                       |
| `/mcp/oauth/authorize`                    | GET/POST | Odoo-login + per-request consent screen; issues an authorization code        |
| `/mcp/oauth/token`                        | POST     | Exchange an authorization code / refresh token for opaque tokens (PKCE S256) |
| `/mcp/oauth/register`                     | POST     | RFC 7591 dynamic client registration (public PKCE client, IP rate-limited)   |

### REST API

All REST endpoints except `/mcp/health` require API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header.

| Endpoint                     | Method | Description                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/mcp/health`                | GET    | Health check (no auth required)      |
| `/mcp/system/info`           | GET    | Get database and server information  |
| `/mcp/auth/validate`         | GET    | Validate API key                     |
| `/mcp/models`                | GET    | List all MCP-enabled models          |
| `/mcp/models/{model}/access` | GET    | Check access permissions for a model |

### XML-RPC API

MCP-specific XML-RPC endpoints with enhanced access control (used by the
[standalone client](#option-3-standalone-local-client-uvx-mcp-server-odoo)):

| Endpoint             | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/mcp/xmlrpc/common` | Authentication services                  |
| `/mcp/xmlrpc/db`     | Database operations                      |
| `/mcp/xmlrpc/object` | Model operations with MCP access control |

## Usage Example

### Testing the Installation

1. **Check health endpoint**:

   ```bash
   curl https://your-odoo.com/mcp/health
   ```

2. **Validate API key**:

   ```bash
   curl https://your-odoo.com/mcp/auth/validate \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **List enabled models**:

   ```bash
   curl https://your-odoo.com/mcp/models \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here"
   ```

4. **Exercise the MCP handshake** (or use
   [MCP Inspector](#option-2-api-key-bearer-token) for an interactive session):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-odoo.com/mcp \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0"}}}'
   ```

## Security Considerations

- **Prefer OAuth for interactive users**: tokens are short-lived, bound to one resource,
  revocable per client, and never need to be copied around
- **API Key Security**: keep API keys secure and rotate them regularly; prefer
  [MCP only](#mcp-only-api-keys) keys so a leak cannot reach general RPC
- **Least privilege**: only enable models that are necessary; grant read-only OAuth
  consent where write access is not needed
- **Model Access**: `call_model_method` is off by default — leave it off unless needed
- **HTTPS**: always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Rate Limiting**: the module includes per-user rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Audit Trail**: all MCP operations, denials and auth attempts are logged
  (**Settings > Technical > MCP > MCP Logs**)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all MCP module tests
/path/to/odoo-bin \
  -d your_database \
  -u mcp_server \
  --test-enable \
  --test-tags /mcp_server \
  --stop-after-init
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Module Not Found</summary>

- Ensure the module is in the correct addons path
- Update the apps list in Odoo (Apps > Update Apps List)
- Check module dependencies are satisfied
- Verify the module manifest file is valid

</details>

<details>
<summary>OAuth Login Fails or Keeps Re-Prompting</summary>

- Confirm MCP is enabled (Settings > MCP Server) **and** the **Allow OAuth 2.1 login**
  switch is on (system parameter `mcp_server.enable_oauth`)
- The authorize/consent screen requires a normal Odoo login for the connecting user —
  check the user is active and can log into the web client
- Check whether the token was revoked or its client deactivated under **Settings >
  Technical > MCP** — the client must re-authenticate after a revocation
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour; clients refresh automatically via the refresh
  token. If the refresh token was already used (rotation reuse), the whole grant is
  revoked as a safety measure — log in again
- Behind a reverse proxy, make sure Odoo sees the correct external HTTPS URL
  (`web.base.url`) so the discovery documents and consent redirects point at the right
  origin

</details>

<details>
<summary>API Key Not Working</summary>

- Verify the key is active in the user's API Keys tab
- A **403** means the key is valid but the user is not in the **MCP User** (or MCP
  Administrator) group — membership is required on every MCP surface; the refusal is
  recorded in the audit log with the user
- Ensure the header is properly formatted (`Authorization: Bearer <key>` on `/mcp`;
  `X-API-Key` on the REST endpoints)
- An **MCP only** key works **only** on `/mcp` — it is rejected on the REST/XML-RPC
  endpoints by design
- Try regenerating the API key
- Check that the user account is active and not archived

</details>

<details>
<summary>Model Access Denied</summary>

- Confirm the model is in the MCP enabled models list (**Settings > Technical > MCP >
  MCP Available Models**)
- Check the specific permissions (read/write/create/delete) for that model
- Verify the user's security group membership
- Ensure the user has Odoo permissions for that model too
- Check if record rules are blocking access
- On an OAuth session: a read-only consent (`mcp:read`) hides and refuses all write
  tools — reconnect and leave the write checkbox checked if writes are needed

</details>

<details>
<summary>Connection Issues</summary>

- Verify your Odoo URL is accessible from the client
- Check if HTTPS is properly configured
- Ensure firewall rules allow the connection
- Test with the health endpoint first: `curl https://your-odoo.com/mcp/health`
- Check Odoo logs for any error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary>Endpoint 404s / "No database is selected"</summary>

- The Odoo instance serves **more than one database**, so Odoo can't tell which one the
  request targets — every `/mcp*` route 404s and the body reads *"No database is
  selected"*
- Resolve the target database at the transport layer — see
  [Multi-Database Deployment](#multi-database-deployment): hostname-based `dbfilter`
  (required for browser OAuth clients), an `X-Odoo-Database: <db>` header (Bearer /
  API-key clients), or pin a single database with `db_name`
- Single-database instances are unaffected — Odoo auto-selects the only database

<summary>Performance Issues</summary>

- Enable only necessary models to reduce overhead
- Use field filtering in API calls to limit data transfer
- Consider implementing caching in your client
- Check if rate limiting is affecting your requests
- Monitor Odoo server resources (CPU, memory, database)
